# Russia-SMO-Interactive-Report

- A interactive visualization project using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) API, attempting to gain insights into the trends and losses of the Russian Military during its 'Special Military Operation' against Ukraine.

- The Russian-Ukraine War, or 'Special Military Operation' has been on going since February, 2022.
Ever since then, both sides lost billions dollars worth of military equipments, infrastructures and personnels. Needless to say of the millions of families becoming refugees of war, leaving homes and cities buried in ashes, and destroying living grounds for generations for the decades to come.

- As the raw data suggests, the interactive report focuses on Russian loss in military equipment and personnel.
The project first uses pandas to process and clean raw dataset, dropping missing and unnecessary datapoints, grouping categories that had name changed, and summarizing city names according to appearing frequency.
